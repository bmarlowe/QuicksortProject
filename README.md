# QuicksortProject
Quicksort algorithm analyzer completed for Algorithms class CMSC 451.

This program generates arrays of 50 random numbers to be sorted, ranging in data size per number from 4 up to 16384.
The Quicksort algorithm is then used to sort them and record analysis data including time and number of critical operations.
Both a recursive version and an iterative version are used to sort each array and the results are displayed for comparison
in the console.
